Hello, welcome to my first repository!

Questions and the answers:

a. What is an issue?
--------------------
A GitHub issue is a tool that helps users track tasks, improvements, bugs, and other project-related activities. It serves as a way to organize and manage project work, making it easier for team members to collaborate effectively.


b. What is a pull request?
--------------------------
A pull request (PR) in version control systems like Git lets developers propose changes to a codebase. After making changes in their branch, they can submit a PR for review, which, if approved, can be merged into the main branch.


c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
---------------------------------------------
1- Go to the original repository on GitHub (not your forked one).
