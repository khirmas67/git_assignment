Hello, welcome to my first repository!

Questions and the answers:

a. What is an issue?
--------------------
A GitHub issue is a tool that helps users track tasks, improvements, bugs, and other project-related activities. It serves as a way to organize and manage project work, making it easier for team members to collaborate effectively.


b. What is a pull request?
--------------------------
A pull request (PR) in version control systems like Git lets developers propose changes to a codebase. After making changes in their branch, they can submit a PR for review, which, if approved, can be merged into the main branch.


c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
---------------------------------------------
1- Go to the original repository on GitHub (not your forked one).
2- You should see a notification asking if you would like to compare and open a pull request from the branch you just pushed.
3- If not, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click on "New pull request."
4- Select your branch in the "compare" dropdown, and the base branch (main)
5- Provide a descriptive title and detailed explanation of what you have done in the pull request 
6- Submit the pull request by clicking "Create pull request."
